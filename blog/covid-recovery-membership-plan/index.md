***Special thanks to author Dave Monahan, Kleer CEO, for this guest post.***

*A message from [Roadside Dental Marketing](/): Many of our clients and readers have asked what they can do proactively do right now – not just in response to the closures and reductions in revenue many are currently experiencing, but also in preparation for what will inevitably be a changing economic atmosphere.*

*Membership plans are a valuable solution that can enable more of your patients to get the care they need at a cost they can afford. They also provide a means for you to bounce back sooner by retaining existing patients and attracting new ones. *

*Please enjoy this guest blog from Kleer’s CEO, Dave Monahan, and don’t hesitate to reach out to them if you have any questions.* – Whitney Speir, Marketing Director

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

The vast majority of dental practices have closed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The sweeping closures impact everyone involved in dentistry, from dentists to practice staff to patients—and extraordinary approaches to surviving and ultimately reviving your dental practice are critical. This blog post explores why you should be thinking of implementing a membership plan now as part of your recovery strategy and how Kleer can help.

Your Patients Will Need Budget-Friendly Access to Care
------------------------------------------------------

Dental practice closures are creating a backlog of dental care treatment needs, from preventative to restorative and cosmetic. When this crisis lifts, patients will want to address their oral care needs, but they will be sensitive to price. Many of them will have lost employer-sponsored dental benefits or experienced financial hardships. Having a [dental membership plan](https://www.kleer.com/about-dental-membership-plans) in place will enable your patients to access the care they need in a budget-friendly way.

Your patients will get exactly what they want. Payments are affordable, prices are transparent, coverage is easy to understand, there are no hassles like deductibles, pre-approvals, and annual maximums. Plus, patient benefits start the minute they join.

With your membership plan, patients will:

-   Have access to simple, affordable and personalized care
-   Have budget-friendly payment options (monthly and annual)
-   Receive benefits immediately upon sign-up
-   Bypass the costs and hassles of insurance—no deductibles, waiting periods, claims denials or paperwork

Your Practice will Need the Additional Patient Visits and Revenue
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By making it easier for patients to get the care they need, a membership plan will help your practice bounce back from the crisis. If your plan is designed and priced correctly, your membership plan patients will visit two to three times more than uninsured patients and [generate twice the revenue](https://www.kleer.com/blog/unlock-uninsured-dental-membership-plan).

The proof is in Kleer’s data. Data collected from Kleer customer practices prove membership plan patients will be your best patients. This graph shows the average results for practices on the Kleer Platform and shows that uninsured patients with a membership plan generate 2.1X more revenue than uninsured patients without it.

We recently drilled into this data in a webinar “Data Validates the ROI of Dental Membership Plans,” that is [available for on-demand playback](https://go.kleer.com/20200325Webinar) and CE.
