" alt="Text: How Artificial Intelligence Can Streamline Your Dental Practice " id="NDI2OjM1MA==-1" class="alignnone wp-image-53123 size-full nitro-lazy" width="760" height="400" />

Trust us – we know you and your dental staff are super busy.

Every day, you’re focused on caring for your patients.

This may include:

- Discussing their needs
- Answering questions
- Providing top-notch dental treatments

And we know fostering a relationship with your patients is crucial for creating a positive environment and boosting your practice’s success.

Your front desk coordinators and receptionists are often the first points of contact when patients step in.

But, wait:

**Who’s there when your patient is online, browsing your site, and trying to get a feel for who you are?**

What if they have questions for you at a time when you’re out of the office?

Wearing too many hats at once gets overwhelming and exhausting for everyone involved.

Plus:

_You may not be able to give your 100% to everything, either._

But don’t worry:

**This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.**

With our world going digital, it’s crucial that you have virtual solutions in your toolbelt.

In this blog, you’ll learn about:

- AI in dentistry
- What chatbots are
- Different types of chatbots
- How they’ll help your practice

## What is artificial intelligence in dentistry?

According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, artificial intelligence in dentistry encompasses a broad spectrum of advanced technologies.

The beauty of AI’s evolution relays information about your dental practice to the patient, assisting them in making decisions with support tools.

**Dental AI provides patients with answers to some of their most common questions and directs them to the information they may be looking for.**

The American Dental Association believes that using AI may help patients trust your diagnoses and treatment plans.

The most common types of AI used in the dental health field include:

- Chatbots
- Appointment confirmation software
- Review management software

## What is a chatbot?

<img src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDY1OjcyNg==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzYwIDQwMCIgd2lkdGg9Ijc2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+" title="Learn three types of chatbots for your dental practice in our blog. Read now! " alt="Text: Chatbots are programmed to ask questions about your patient&#39;s symptoms, help patients receive emergency dental care, transfer data to your patient&#39;s record. " id="NDY1OjcyNg==-1" class="alignnone wp-image-53124 size-full nitro-lazy" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw" width="760" height="400" />

Dental chatbots can perform a number of important services.

Don’t let the “bot” in the name fool you.

**They’re a type of AI software that may be programmed to simulate a natural conversation with your patient.**

Think of a chatbot as your virtual AI assistant.

When you go to open your website, the [chatbot](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/blog/webchat/) will often pop up on the side of the screen, ready to help.

Many platforms have pre-made templates you can use as a guide for what you could say.

And the best part?

**There are several different chatbots available!**

With advancements in artificial intelligence, the market for healthcare chatbots is expected to continue growing in the next four years, making the market worth a whopping [$703.2 million.<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Global News Wire website…</span>](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/15/1970794/0/en/Healthcare-Chatbots-Market-worth-703-2-million-by-2025-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20symptom%20checking,22.2%25%20during%20the%20forecast%20period.&text=They%20mostly%20use%20chatbots%20for,and%20to%20take%20medical%20guidance.)

Some of the most popular chatbots include:

- ChatCompose
- Smartbot360
- The Emergency Dental Virtual Assistant

### Chatcompose

In the last two years alone, searches for “chatcompose” have **increased by 9500%.**

How is such a large percentage possible?

[Chatcompose<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Chatcompose website…</span>](https://www.chatcompose.com/) allows you to **build your own sales and conversation scripts.**

The chatbots will ask your patients questions about their symptoms and then send the data to your practice.

Then, they’ll help your patients easily schedule appointments with you!

### Smartbot360

Similarly, [Smartbot360<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Smartbot360 website…</span>](https://smartbot360.com/) is a **HIPAA-compliant chatbot software used by healthcare providers and businesses** all across the United States and Canada.

Their chatbots can be set up in minutes, thanks to:

- Ready-to-use templates
- Experts who can help you create a custom chatbot

### The Emergency Dental Virtual Assistant

The [Emergency Dental Virtual Assistant<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Voicebot.AI website…</span>](https://voicebot.ai/2020/07/08/new-dentistry-chatbot-helps-triage-patients-during-covid-19-crisis/) has been very successful in helping patients receive emergency care throughout the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis.

**It’s a virtual triage tool that offers patients access to screening 24/7 and asks them questions to provide recommendations for the next steps in a dental emergency.**

It’ll allow you to follow up with your patients on the phone or via the HIPAA-complaint texting application.

In addition:

**The information exchanged in the chatbot and texting applications can simply be transferred into your patients’ records.**

## What is appointment confirmation software?

This type of software is on the rise in dental practices all over.

It’s expected to grow [13.1%<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Guru Factors website…</span>](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/989475/appointment-scheduling-software-market-statistics-2019-key-factors-behind-markets-growth) in the next five years.

**Appointment confirmation software is a form of automated practice management that’s geared toward managing appointments and scheduling.**

It can give your patients peace of mind by relaying updates about your office (e.g. if you’re out sick).

And it can even send a personalized note to new patients, such as “Thank you” or “Welcome”!

Additionally, it may be used to:

- Ping your patients with reminders about their upcoming visits
- Provide immediate confirmation about their appointments
- Aid your patient in rescheduling or canceling an appointment
- Send out a no-show notice

## What is review management software?

**Review management software encourages patients to leave feedback about their experience at your dental practice.**

Recent studies show that **[70%<span class="sr-only">… This text opens a new tab to the Search Engineland website…</span>](https://searchengineland.com/70-consumers-will-leave-review-business-asked-262802) of consumers will leave a review if asked.**

Reviews are essential because they’ll help potential patients searching for a dentist gain trust in your practice.

And:

Encouraging your patients to provide feedback can allow your practice to know how to keep up the good work or improve.

## What are the benefits of artificial intelligence in dentistry?

AI makes everyone’s lives easier!

Artificial intelligence:

- Offers **support around the clock** (even when no one is in the office!)
- Sends patients **reminders about their appointments** or notify them about the state of the visit
- Explains **treatment costs** and share details about financing options
- Provides **real-time information** instantly
- Informs patients of your **availability**
- Allows patients to **cancel or reschedule** appointments easily
- Requests honest, anonymous **feedback from your patients** about their treatment to help improve your practice
- Reduces the **impact of a crisis**

**In addition to making your patients’ lives easier and simultaneously increasing the quality of care, advanced technology in dentistry benefits dentists like you.**

For example, you’ll enjoy:

- Improved accuracy
- Restorative dental aid
- Orthodontic tracking

### Improved accuracy

Data analysis and visualization methods using AI are more accurate than ever.

With a rise in telemedicine, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, accuracy is crucial in diagnosing and treating a patient.

During a [virtual consultation](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/services/websites/dental/virtual-consultations/), your dental AI tools can offer ideal recommendations for care.

In addition:

**These algorithms will be able to inspect 3-D models and imaging scans that may catch something you might have missed with your naked eye.**

You’ll save time and any uncertainty you may have about a diagnosis with artificial intelligence.

### Restorative dental aid

Did you know you’re already witnessing the impact of AI in dentistry through restorative dental services?

Think about it.

Just to name a few, we have:

- CEREC same-day crowns
- Shade matching dentures
- Automated quality control

Modern technology allows for modern methods in dentistry.

**Modern dentistry leads to faster treatment times, more effectiveness, and more convenience for everyone involved.**

For example:

Take same-day crowns.

**You and your patient can say goodbye to the days of waiting up to two weeks for a dental lab to finish making your restoration!**

### Orthodontic tracking

Intra-oral cameras provide accurate imaging of your patient’s teeth.

**With Invisalign’s SmartTrack technology, you’re able to map out treatment plans and preview new smiles with ease.**

Aligners are custom-made for your patient’s teeth, eliminating gum irritation.

Yes, AI is just technology.

But with **purpose and functionality**, it connects you to your patients in an accessible and user-friendly platform.

## Need help taking some tasks off your plate?

We know this may be a lot of new information to take in at once.

But:

**If you’re not changing and evolving with what is to become our future, you may get left behind in the past.**

And that’s where we come in!

At Roadside Dental Marketing, we’ll handle keeping you updated with the latest news in the dental world.
