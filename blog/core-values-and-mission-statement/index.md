published January 17, 2020Last updated July 24, 2020 <span class="readtime"></span>

One of our favorite taglines we love to tout is, *“We started this journey in 1999 – before ‘Google’ was a verb!”*

With more than 20 years of expertise in dental marketing, it could be very easy to get stuck in an old, comfortable mindset. We know a lot of our doctors suffer from the same issue. But any company that wants to grow and keep up with the ever-changing world of establishing and growing a digital presence has to mindfully design the vision and goals desired to grow to each and every year.

*The exercise of really looking at what our core values and mission statement are for 2020 has been a blast for us here at Roadside.*

Is it just me or does this year – being the end of a decade and the start of a new one – seem super special?

**Roadside has never been happier, healthier, and more productive.**

Why?

Because we are learning to really look at whole-life goals and lifestyle habits. This is true, not just for me and for my family, but for my employees, their families and for my clients and their families.

I think we are all ready to come from an authentic, honest, empowering, abundant place. That just sounds so good, right?

**This is where we are coming from:**

**Truly caring, not just about getting “paid,” (being a business and all), but really caring about and working to improve and grow our clients’ business so *they* can have the practice and lifestyle they want to manifest!**

We are happier serving our clients, and our clients are happier knowing their marketing company truly cares and that they are not just a number in the world of corporate America!

With that, I’d like to share with you Roadside’s Core Values and Mission Statement:

<img src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDM5OjIyMA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzYwIDgwMCIgd2lkdGg9Ijc2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI4MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+" alt="Roadside&#39;s core values" id="NDM5OjIyMA==-1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39525 nitro-lazy" width="760" height="800" />

Roadside’s Core Values
----------------------

Collectively and individually, we:

-   *Empower and serve* others with generosity and brilliance
-   *Invent* solutions and simplify complexity
-   Are *authentic*, transparent, and honest
-   *Elevate* accountability
-   *Better ourselves* every day (and have fun doing it!)
-   *Believe in giving* as abundantly as we’ve received
-   *Treat others* as we want to be treated

Roadside’s Mission Statement
----------------------------

Roadside’s Unwavering Mission is to empower and serve others by simplifying the complex, EPIC world of online marketing, enabling others to grow and achieve their ultimate goals in business and life!

Your Core Values and Mission Statement for 2020
-----------------------------------------------

I encourage you to do the same. Don’t just keep saying, *“I need more patients, I need to make more money,” – *think about the reasons behind it. WHY do you want that?

*“I want to serve my community as the best dentist they’ve ever had an experience with.”*

*“I want to serve my community’s whole health, not just one tooth at a time.”*

*“I want to be productive at work so I can build the freedom to have the life I dream of.”*

Review your Core Values and Mission Statement for 2020. Think differently, add in how you can give more, how you can help make this crazy, busy world just a little better. And then make sure we know of all the beautiful changes you want to see and focus on so we can help you share it with your community!

Our gift to you: Outline your core values and mission statement
