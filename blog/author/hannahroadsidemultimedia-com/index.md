About The Author

A four-time dental implant champion and three-time braceface survivor, Hannah Baird knows a thing or two about being a dental patient. Combine that with her public relations and content marketing background, and you‚Äôve got a ghostwriter who knows how to persuade your patients with the power of the written word. As Roadside‚Äôs marketing copywriter, Hannah helps transform our clients‚Äô dental jargon into relatable content that helps patients see the value of dentistry and overcome barriers holding them back. Her competitiveness works to your advantage as she aims to land and keep our clients on page one of Google. Away from her keyboard, Hannah fills her time crafting and planning parties, traveling with her fiance (\#basic), creating memories with friends and family near and far, and cheering on her alma mater during football season (WSU - go Cougs!).
