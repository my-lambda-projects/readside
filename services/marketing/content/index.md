Search engines (and patients!) LOVE quality content

### Content marketing is a key to visibility on search engines and converting new patients.

<img src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTg0OjMxOA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzUwIDc1MCIgd2lkdGg9Ijc1MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3NTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+" title="Content marketing can get you to the top of Google!" alt="One of our websites for dentists: Dr. Silberman became Google’s featured snippet - thanks to content marketing." id="NTg0OjMxOA==-1" class="nitro-lazy" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">First, let’s cover what content marketing is. When you launch a new [dental website](/services/websites/dental/), you may think that you’re good to go and you never need to touch it again. Sadly, that’s not the case. Your website is a living and breathing machine and it NEEDS fresh, valuable content to compete online. So, why is content important?</span>

1.  <span style="font-weight:400;">Content marketing enables you to continue to rank on Google and search engines – </span><a href="#rankings" class="popup-inline"><span style="font-weight:400;">HOW?</span></a>
2.  <span style="font-weight:400;">Trust-building content convinces potential patients to choose you over the competition – </span><a href="#competition" class="popup-inline"><span style="font-weight:400;">HOW?</span></a>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When you regularly market your practice with quality and relevant content, you are telling Google you mean business. You are establishing trust and authority. You are helping Google AND real people see you’re the dental expert in your community.</span>

<a href="#content-kinds" class="scrollto btn-standard medium solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta"><span>What Kinds of Content Should You Create?</span></a>

Google Loves Fresh Content:

Some of the top ranking factors Google considers are:

-   **Time**: How long someone stays on your website.
-   **Pages per session**: The average number of pages viewed during a session on your website.
-   **Bounce rate**: The percentage of people who visit your website and bounce off after visiting one page.

These stats tell us that if people are on your website and they stay on it for a long time, it tells Google you have authoritative, relevant content on your website. The longer someone stays on your website, the better.

You Will Stand Out From Your Competition:

People are always searching for answers to their questions.

When a patient finds your content AND it answers their questions:

-   It builds trust with them. They will want to continue to browse your website to find more answers.
-   It creates a huge opportunity to share your content with their friends and family. They will link back to your content. Links are extremely important as they show Google you’re popular in your community.

### What kinds of content marketing do you need?

PRO TIP: Think like a patient - "What’s in it for me?" (WiiFM)

Answer Questions

You must create content that focuses on how what you do benefits your users, tackles their barriers, and solves their problems.

Your content should promote your services while making it about the benefits to your patients – not just about the clinical side of the procedure.

Webpage

For example, let’s say you want to increase dental implants cases. Start by making sure you website has a page about dental implants. On that page, don’t just talk about the technical details. Instead, think like a patient – \#WiiFM. This page should address:

-   
    What dental implants are.

-   
    How dental implants benefit patients.

-   
    Actual before and after photos of dental implant cases.

-   
    Answers to frequently asked questions.

-   
    … and a final call to action to request a complimentary consultation.

Blog Posts

Continuing with our dental implants focus, you’ll need blog posts to support your new dental implants page. Consider using your blog to answer real questions your patients and community are asking about dental implants. Those could include:

-   
    Am I a candidate for dental implants?

-   
    How much do dental implants cost?

-   
    Implants or dentures: Which option is right for you?

-   
    Are dental implants painful?

Visual Graphics

Visuals are super important for content marketing. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words! Clear, educational, informative, and attractive visual content can play a large part in educating and building trust in patients.

What types of visuals should you include in your content marketing strategy?

-   
    Infographics

-   
    eBooks

-   
    Other graphics to help answer patients’ questions – visually

Case Studies

Real-life results speak louder than anything else you can say. Show off your work in a Smile Gallery or portfolio, and highlight real patient before and after photos so potential patients feel inspired to choose you for their OWN smile transformation.

Case studies should focus on:

-   
    What problems the patient experienced.

-   
    How the doctor solved those problems.

-   
    Before and after photos of the patient’s smile.

-   
    The patient’s testimonial of getting treatment from this dentist.

Videos

Videos are super important for content marketing… after all, they can increase chances of showing up in search results by 157%. Whether you go the professional or DIY route, the video topic possibilities are endless!

-   
    Answering patients’ questions.

-   
    Interviewing a patient who finished his or her implants case.

-   
    Walking his users through what to expect with the dental implants procedure.

-   
    Giving a “behind the scenes” look of how you plan treatment.

Promotion

This part is important! You don’t want to just publish amazing content and then let it sit there collecting dust. You want it to be seen!

-   
    Send email blasts to share new content with your current patients.

-   
    Include a special offer in promotional materials highlighting your top services.

-   
    Reach out to influencers and share your fresh new content to get links to your site.

Social Media

Use social media to FULL advantage to get your shiny new content in front of as many people as possible:

-   
    Post about your content with strong calls to action to drive your audience to click through to your website (and consider boosting the post to reach a larger, targeted audience).

-   
    Do a Facebook live session to answer patients’ questions about specific treatments.

-   
    Post your videos on YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook while linking back to your website to gain exposure.
