You want new patients, but how in the heck are people going to find you?

With 88% of people searching for healthcare providers through search engines, **dental SEO** is crucial to help people find your dental office.

People using these search engines to find a provider have not made a final decision, and have an extremely high intent to buy. Don’t miss out on the number-one way of accessing these potential new patients before your competitors do.

### Don’t stress! Our dental SEO experts can help.

Hey, we get it. You don’t have the time to keep up with ongoing SEO maintenance. That’s where we step in and make your life easier with a tailored **dental SEO** strategy solidly based on:

-   
    ROI-driven SEO strategy

-   
    Transparency and communication

-   
    Technical SEO and on-page optimization

    Quality optimized content

Been burned by SEO companies in the past?
-----------------------------------------

You may be one of many professionals who’ve felt scammed by other SEO companies with false promises of getting to page one of Google within 30 days. Or perhaps you’ve heard you don’t actually need ongoing SEO. It’s no wonder many dentists aren’t sure if SEO is a good investment or not.

A [**dental SEO company**](/) should provide transparent results with holistic technical and on-page SEO practices.

### Frequently asked questions about SEO

(We’ve heard them all!) Get the answers below!

-   <span class="accordion-title">I’ve been told I don’t need ongoing SEO work. Is that true?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">So, you may have heard the whispers that “SEO is dead! All you need is a solid foundation.” Is it true? </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">Well, to illustrate the answer to that question, consider this:</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">A new car doesn’t need maintenance right away. But what happens if you never provide maintenance? Over time, that car will break down, and will end up costing you more money than regular maintenance would have. </span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">SEO is much the same. Over time, if you hope to stay relevant and visible, you will have to invest in ongoing SEO. And, it is much more affordable to have ongoing work done than a complete overhaul later on!</span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">That said, there are some SEO methods considered “dead” to Google and search engines while some methods are considered the stars of getting excellent rankings.</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Check out our blog: </span>*<span style="font-weight:400;">Ongoing SEO… A Good Investment or a Waste of Money? </span>*<span style="font-weight:400;">Our SEO Director Kelsey will share his insight on the importance of ongoing SEO work and three tactics that are way outdated.</span>

    <a href="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/blog/ongoing-seo/" class="btn-standard small solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta">Read It Here</a>

-   <span class="accordion-title">Can you get me on page 1 of Google?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">We’re confident we can get your business to rank higher on Google through various methods, including:</span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">Search engine marketing ads (page 1 results guaranteed!)</span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">Ongoing SEO work</span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">Inbound linking</span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">These methods are crucial to any marketing and SEO strategy. It’s important to note SEO involves A LOT of variables that need to fit into place to see the results you’re looking for.</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">What we’re saying is…</span> y<span style="font-weight:400;">ou will not rank on page 1 of Google overnight. It’s a marathon, not a sprint; it will take time and endurance to get high-quality results. However, we’re confident we can help you improve your rankings and get to the finish line: More new patients!</span>

-   <span class="accordion-title">How much does SEO cost?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">The cost of SEO is based on multiple factors, including your industry, the level of competition in your geographical area, and the size and quality of your website. </span> <span style="font-weight:400;">We provide transparent, no-fuss marketing package recommendations according to your specific needs. </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">**In other words, our monthly dental SEO packages are not one-size-fits-all!** We’ll tailor a package that we believe fits your specific area and goals, and we’ll happily answer any questions you have about it. </span>

-   <span class="accordion-title">How long does it take to get results from SEO?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">SEO is an ongoing process, one that never finishes (you can thank Google and its 500-700 yearly algorithm changes for that). Some could see results immediately, while others have to wait months.</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Ask yourself: </span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">How much competition is in my local area? </span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">How good are my backlinks? </span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">How much am I willing to invest in my SEO? </span>
    -   <span style="font-weight:400;">Am I building/launching a new website, or has my brand been around for years? </span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">All of these factors can influence how soon you’ll see results. </span>

     

-   <span class="accordion-title">Does good content equal high rankings in Google?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">You might expect the answer to be YES, but truthfully it is a maybe. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Good content by itself will not always translate into good rankings. To rank high on Google, you need to combine great content with the value this content provides for the reader.</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">The recipe for success is to focus on creating quality content, with value for the reader, and tie that content into a solid digital marketing strategy which should include consistent promotion and high-authority backlinks from reputable domains.</span>

     

-   <span class="accordion-title">How do you find the right keywords to rank for?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">The old way of keyword research included picking one or two word key phrases and littering your content as many times as possible with these phrases. As Google and search engines have evolved to better serve the needs of their users, this kind of approach no longer works (and it can, in fact, hurt you). </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">We utilize a number of industry-leading tools to determine the best phrases, topics, and long-tail variations to include in your custom content. We then use those keywords naturally throughout your website, in headings, image descriptions, page titles, meta descriptions, and elsewhere. </span>

     

-   <span class="accordion-title">Why do my Google rankings fluctuate?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">Unfortunately there is no way around it, each day there are multiple changes to algorithms. Therefore, rankings fluctuate accordingly.</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">That being said, your perceived rankings (or what you see when you perform a search) will also fluctuate based on Google’s “personalized search results” which tailors the results based on your past queries rather than showing the same results to every person. Google takes into account past searches, location, browser history and much more in order to display the most relevant results. The results you see will vary greatly if you search from home, your office, or from a mobile device. </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">Another point to keep in mind is that there are usually only ten spots on any given page, but likely there are hundreds of competitors, each likely having their own SEO work completed. Your website could move up or down based on their influences as well, which is why it’s vital to have ongoing SEO work performed on your website over time. </span>

    <span style="font-weight:400;">Ready to get started? Schedule a no-strings consultation with our experts and see if we’re the right team for you.</span>

    <a href="https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/angela3/marketing-planning-and-review-meeting" class="btn-standard small solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta">Book Your Call Online</a>

     

-   <span class="accordion-title">Should I start SEO before or after my website is built?</span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">At the very core, a solid SEO foundation should be implemented from the very beginning – the launch of your new website. The first time Google crawls your website, you want it to be impressive. </span>
    <span style="font-weight:400;">However, ongoing optimization efforts can usually wait until after launch. There are, of course, exceptions to that rule, one being getting a head-start on your local listings and citations, which can be done prior to your website going live.</span>
