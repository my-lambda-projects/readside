#### Are your current digital marketing efforts producing results?

Instead of passively waiting for referrals and for patients to magically find you, purposeful, intentional dental marketing is vital to continually grow your business.

We could compare your practice to a houseplant. Not many houseplants can survive without sunlight and regular watering. **Marketing is the equivalent to hydration and sunlight for your business!**

And, just like houseplants have different needs, no two practices are alike. That’s why Roadside’s dental marketing packages are completely customizable based on your area, competition, goals, and budget.

Find answers to our most frequently asked questions!

-   <span class="accordion-title">Is dental marketing really necessary? We've always been able to rely on referrals.</span>
    Referrals ARE great! BUT you need to make sure your online presence helps them to act now and choose you.
    The way dental patients shop now is completely different than it was ten years ago. Even if a person is referred by a friend or family member, they’re going to check you out online. Period. They’re looking at your reviews, what others are saying about you, they’re checking out your location to see if it’s convenient, they’re trying to figure out if you’re in-network with their insurance, they’re seeing what your practice’s personality looks like on social media…

    The bottom line is this: Does your online presence give them enough reasons to choose you?

    We invite you to schedule a no-risk call with our team to learn how we can help.

    <a href="https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/angela3/marketing-planning-and-review-meeting" class="btn-standard medium solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta">Schedule a Call</a>

-   <span class="accordion-title">I have a great dental website. Isn't that enough?</span>
    If you have a great website, that’s AWESOME! You have a good foundation for your online presence.
    Imagine you were about to build a new home. You buy the land, a foundation is laid, and then… that’s it! You’re done, right? Wrong!

    Just as your new home would need framing, a roof, and all the other components that make up a house, your website is really only the foundation of your marketing efforts. More is needed!

    Schedule a call with our team to get our honest recommendations for a marketing strategy that matches your goals and budget – no strings attached!

-   <span class="accordion-title">We're a specialty practice and our patients come primarily from referrals. Do we need marketing?</span>
    YES! Specialists are often competing against the “all-in-one” practices where everything is under one roof. And, referred patients are spying you out online before they officially commit. They’re looking at your reviews, checking out your location, figuring out if you’re in-network with their insurance. Therefore, a solid, strong, consistent online reputation is very important.
    However, the marketing services best for a specialist are going to be different than the services recommended for a general dentist. This is where our customized marketing strategy will help you determine the best options for YOUR unique needs.

-   <span class="accordion-title">What if I'm not sure what I need?</span>
    We’ve got you!
    Our team of experts can take a look at your existing online presence, the competition in your area, and other critical factors and can make recommendations based on your unique situation. Schedule a time to discuss the options right for you today.
