Angela and I joined the first-time attendee meeting bright and early at 7:00AM on day one, where Kim and Heather welcomed first-timers and gave them a TON of valuable information to help each and every one of them make a success of their first conference.<\/p>\n<p>We hopped up on stage briefly to remind them all to pop by our booth for their gift and let them know where to find us. Angela also gave a plug for our famous Seattle Chocolates and told the entire group about my weight-lifting skills loading 35 pounds of chocolate into the overhead bin on the airplane (there was no way we were going to check those precious chocolates &#8211; carry-on only!)<\/p>\n<h2>\u201cYou\u2019re like the Chik-fil-A of vendors!\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>\ud83d\udc46 This.<\/p>\n<p>If I could sum up the vibe at the Roadside booth, I\u2019d do it with this, which a member said to me as she observed the crowd at our booth.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, it was such a compliment (love us some Chik-fil-A!) but we have to give props to our amazing team who worked together like a well-oiled machine to take care of every person who stopped by our booth to chat.<\/p>\n<p>In all seriousness, we loved every second of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interacting with dental office office managers from across the country and hearing first-hand their challenges, goals, accomplishments, and successes is one of our favorite aspects of the AADOM Conference.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Marketing Masterclass<\/h2>\n<p>On Friday morning, Angela and I taught our Marketing Masterclass workshop, where attendees were guided on setting up a 12-month marketing action plan for their practices. They all walked away with a 40+ page workbook and ideas to implement right away, as well as homework to help them through the next year of marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-53132 size-full\" title=\"Our Marketing Masterclass helped attendees create a 12-month marketing action plan for the coming year.\" src=\"https:\/\/www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021-aadom-conference-highlights.png\" alt=\"Snapshots of our marketing masterclass at the AADOM conference\" width=\"760\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021-aadom-conference-highlights.png 760w, https:\/\/www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021-aadom-conference-highlights-480x253.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 760px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We LOVE teaching on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, it\u2019s one of our favorite educational sessions we\u2019ve ever created.

There is something pretty great about seeing a group of grown adults throwing things at each other, ducking and dodging, even standing on chairs to get the snowballs farther across the room. \ud83e\udd23<\/p>\n<p>Afterward, Angela and I answered some of the questions, but time prevented us from covering them all. After we got back, we wanted to make sure to answer ALL of the great questions attendees had about their marketing, so we filmed a quick video to do so. In it we answered questions about reviews, getting your team involved in marketing, and more. It\u2019s super valuable information for ANY practice, so we made it available to everyone! \ud83d\udc47 Watch below or <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ofhR0YurnEc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here<\/a> to watch on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ofhR0YurnEc\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Brie Clark, Practice Manager at Frederick Dental Group in Frederick, Maryland, has been attending our virtual and in-person workshops for years.

Many attendees make a pit stop by our booth daily to grab a few for a pick-me-up during their afternoon classes.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, every year we bring along thousands of buttons with funny and sarcastic sayings. I LOVE when I see an AADOM member come to the booth with a \u201cvintage\u201d button from a past conference! This year\u2019s buttons were a hit and included sayings like \u201cSilently judging your teeth\u201d (sad but true!), \u201cNothing ruins a Friday like realizing it\u2019s Thursday,\u201d and \u201cIf my mouth doesn\u2019t say it, my face definitely will.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>AADOM loves its sponsors and vendors<\/h2>\n<p>One of the things we love about attending the AADOM Conference are the many valuable resources AADOM puts together for its sponsors and vendors.<\/p>\n<p>Our entire team attended the Anatomy of a Gatekeeper presentation with Lorie Streeter and learned how to become the HERO for our office managers and create and nurture strong relationships along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Divina and Lyss, two of our Marketing Account Managers, also attended the Key Opinion Leader panel, a group of top practice leaders from around the country, where they learned important tips for effective communication and how we can really serve them in the best possible way. They came away from that panel PUMPED to try out some new tips they learned!<\/p>\n<p>Those are just two examples of how the AADOM team goes above and beyond to make the conference an enriching experience, not just for attendees, but for sponsors and vendors as well.<\/p>\n<h2>See y\u2019all in Scottsdale!<\/h2>\n<p>We can\u2019t wait for #AADOM22 next September.
