About Harmony Dental
--------------------

A close-knit practice located in the family-friendly Beaverton, OR community, Harmony Dental became a part of the Roadside family in 2014. Our relationship started by building a responsive website, accessible on any device. Fast forward a few a years later: While their website was getting positive results, **it was time to upgrade the technology** to keep them ahead of their competition.

Taking the stress away

Kathy is the rockstar Business Manager at Harmony Dental. On top of her many responsibilities to keep Harmony Dental running smoothly, the practice was going through a rough year with staff layoffs where she had to go through the Front Desk duties by herself.

> “You ladies just walked me through it – I was on the phone with Angela and was like ‘I don’t know where to begin to do this,’ and you’re like **‘Let’s just talk.’** You asked me the questions, we walked through it, and we were done.” – Kathy

We heard Kathy’s struggles and completely understood she didn’t have the time to market Harmony Dental AND go through the process of updating the website. We listened and **took all of those responsibilities off her plate.**

<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aObpUH5D_48" class="video-link btn-standard medium solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta"><em></em><span>Kathy Will Tell You The Story</span></a>

Building dental websites can be fun

[<span class="et_pb_image_wrap"><img src="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harmony-dental-case-study-02.png" title="We make building websites super fun!" alt="A preview of a video clip of Angela speaking with a Harmony Dental team member" class="wp-image-43777" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" srcset="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harmony-dental-case-study-02.png 750w, https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harmony-dental-case-study-02-300x286.png 300w, https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harmony-dental-case-study-02-610x582.png 610w, https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/harmony-dental-case-study-02-350x334.png 350w" width="750" height="715" /></span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6J5GCQ9nxA)

New technology. Same amazing team.

To make Kathy’s life easier, we scheduled a quick 30-minute call with her and discussed her likes and dislikes of her current site and transferred it to the updated responsive dental website. We took care of the rest:

-   **Highlighting their commitment to integrity, family, and health:** Harmony Dental is proud to deliver high-quality dentistry while offering outstanding customer service. In their updated website, we highlighted that even further by integrating a new team photo and going in-depth what a patient could expect at every visit with Harmony Dental.

-   **Adding pops of color:** Harmony Dental loved the warm colors on their current site. The greens, browns, and beige represent the Pacific Northwest, but something was missing. During our quick call with Kathy, she mentioned about the use of orange for their office decor. We took that inspiration and added a calming orange as the accent color for the website, including the call to actions.

### What did Kathy say?

“Working with the ladies there is great because they have been in the dental trenches themselves and understand our needs and limitations. I never feel like a complete computer idiot when talking with them; they are down to earth. It is just like working with your friends at your office.

“Besides all the great customer service and support, of course, there are the results. Our online presence has continually grown since we have been working with Roadside. We are in an extremely competitive market, yet they have been able to deliver results for us.”
