Case Study: Children's Dental Professionals
===========================================

See how we helped this team of **superhuman moms + pediatric dentists** connect with parents online.

![Preview of the Children's Dental Professionals new website](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/childrens-dental-professionals-homepage.jpg "Helping this team of superhuman moms / pediatric dentists connect with their patients online.")

About Children's Dental Professionals
-------------------------------------

As moms themselves, Dr. Walker, Dr. Frazier, and Dr. Parr were a pediatric dream team who **could put even the most anxious kids at ease in the dental chair – *no small feat!*** They had an incredible talent for making dentistry fun, developing deep relationships and trust with children and parents alike.

When this [trio of board-certified pediatric dentists in Wichita, KS<span class="sr-only">…Opens in a new window to client’s About page…</span>](https://www.jumpreachgrowsmile.com/about/) came to us for a website makeover, we knew we had something special on our hands.

![Preview of the old Children's Dental Professionals website pointing out the problems.](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/desktop-Childrens-Dental-case-study-before.png "Their old website wasn't doing them any favors!")

### The Challenge

Children’s Dental Professionals’ needed a fresh new website that **showcased their modern, friendly office and commitment to serving families with above-and-beyond dental care**.

Unfortunately, their old website just wasn’t up to snuff:

-   Clunky, outdated, cookie-cutter design

-   Very few opportunities for conversion

-   Difficult-to-digest blocks of text
-   Sub-par stock photography

-   Poor mobile experience

-   Didn’t adequately convey their unique approach

**They needed their new website to:**

-   Have a fresh, modern design that reflected their office culture and contemporary technology

-   Portray the brightness of the office, while still appearing professional and classy
-   Have plenty of compelling opportunities for conversion to drive new business

-   Have easy-to-digest, engaging content that speaks to their value

-   Be super intuitive with easy-to-find key resources on desktop, mobile, and tablet
-   Build trust with authentic, fun photos of the office and team

The Solution
------------

### A shiny new website worthy of their value and optimized to boost business.

Modern refresh

-   The old website used a template that looked **generic and behind the times**. It also **wasn’t mobile-friendly**.

-   We gave them a full website makeover with a **bright and cheery look**, while still feeling **classy** (*not* cheesy!).

-   We revamped the navigation and user experience to make it **super intuitive** for current and new patients to find what they needed.

-   We **optimized the mobile view** to better serve the way most busy parents were interacting with their site.

Build trust

-   The top-notch team at Children’s Dental Professionals clearly **goes the extra mile** for their patients, but their old website **didn’t do that value justice**.

-   We overhauled the copy to hone in their **personal, energetic, and family-oriented feel**. The goal was to make it feel like you knew them before walking through the door.

-   We filled the site with **genuine photos** of the staff working with **real patients and families**. It’s hard not to smile when browsing through all the friendly faces!

Boost new business

-   Their old site **lacked engaging calls to actions,** causing them to miss out on new business.

-   We designed the whole site with **conversions top-of-mind**, pulling visitors in with compelling copy followed by clearly telling them what steps to take.

-   We **highlighted all the conveniences** they offer and gave **clear information** on what to expect, making it an easy “yes!”

### What are their patients saying about the new website?

*This is an amazing website! Easy to navigate and provides wonderful information about all 3 professionals!*

Virginia L., Actual Patient

*Love the new website – all the pictures, great information, and personal information about the Doctors.*

Jennifer W., Actual Patient

These results speak for themselves!

Children's Dental Professionals' website saw an incredible boost in traffic and SEO power ***within just 90 days of launch.***
