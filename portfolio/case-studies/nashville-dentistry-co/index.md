Case Study: Nashville Dentistry Co.
===================================

See how this startup went from general services to a **cosmetic-focused practice in three years!**

<a href="https://www.nashvilledentistryco.com/" class="visit-website"><img src="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-case-study-nashville-dentistry-website-preview.jpg" title="See how this startup went from general services to a cosmetic-focused practice in three years!" alt="Preview of Nashville Dentistry Co&#39;s new website" class="et_pb_image_standard_1" /></a>

About Nashville Dentistry Co.
-----------------------------

Dr. Ashish Patel opened [Nashville Dentistry Co. <span class="sr-only">… Opens in a new window to Dr. Patel’s dental website… </span>](https://www.nashvilledentistryco.com/) in the heart of Brentwood, TN. He envisioned his new business as a modern, cutting-edge practice to reflect his advanced skills and training. His goal was to have a cosmetic-focused dental practice but needed to start off with broad, bread-and-butter services to grow.  

![Preview of the hassles Nashville Dentistry Co went through as a startup practice](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-nashville-dentistry-website-before-desktop.png "Nashville Dentistry Co. needed a new website for their new practice. ")

The Challenge
-------------

Being a fresh, new dental practice, Dr. Patel had A LOT to deal with, including:

-   Needing an online presence (website, social media, Google My Business listings, etc.)
-   Dealing with the construction of his new office
-   Figuring out the logistics of running a business

Dr. Patel knew he needed to hit the ground running – and fast. He needed his new website to:

-   Reflect the same modern, sleek look of his office
-   Show off his expertise and the technology he’s invested in
-   Evoke trust and respect to anyone landing on his site

<a href="#website" class="scrollto btn-standard medium solid-style-accentb solid-style-hv-accenta"><span>See What We Did</span></a>

The Solution
------------

### Create a modern + friendly experience. Go big + bold with the design.

[<span class="et_pb_image_wrap"><img src="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-nashville-dentistry-website-after-mobile.png" title="Check out Nashville Dentistry Co&#39;s beautiful website!" alt="Dr. Ashish Patel&#39;s new website with a interactive video hero, sleek design, and online conveniences." class="wp-image-48852" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-nashville-dentistry-website-after-mobile.png 500w, https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-nashville-dentistry-website-after-mobile-480x610.png 480w" width="500" height="635" /></span>](https://www.nashvilledentistryco.com/)

Telling a story through videos + photography.

-   Stock photos are old school (and lame!). People spot them instantly.

-   Dr. Patel knew this and invested in a professional videographer and photographer.

-   We created an interactive video hero area, giving users a virtual tour of the office. 

-   The virtual tour continued with his custom photos peppered throughout the site.

Going bold with the design (just like the doc).

-   Dr. Patel didn’t want his website a boring, templated design.

-   His office is clean, sleek with the best dental technologies available. He wanted his website the same way.
-   Keeping the website fresh and clean, we used white space and bright greens to grab people’s attention right away.

-   Created custom borders and overlays to match the office’s architecture and aesthetics.

Convenience from the website to the office.

-   People are busy. And, they have many barriers of visiting dentists – avoiding them altogether.

-   Dr. Patel breaks down those patient barriers with valet parking, modern technology, early and evening hours, and TVs in the ceilings.

-   He kept it going online by allowing people to schedule their appointments online, offering virtual consultations, and offering New Patient Specials.

-   From the office to the virtual experience, his website features all of his conveniences. We show his office décor through photos, placed large calls to action to book online, created a dedicated [dental virtual consultation page](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/services/websites/dental/virtual-consultations/), and stated his New Patient Specials throughout the site.

-   Placed multiple trust factors with testimonials and “Top Dentist” awards as his practice grew.

SEM Ads:

-   
    Dr. Patel was going up against docs who’ve established a solid business and online foundation.

Community connections:

-   
    Hardcore sales tactics are **old news** – and \#1 way to a failing business.

-   
    The best way to **get referrals** is by connecting with your community.

-   
    Dr. Patel sponsored many **local businesses**.

-   
    He **shared about his continuing education** courses with top dental associations.

![Examples of Dr. Patel being active on social media](https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/roadside-dental-marketing-nashville-dentistry-website-engaging-desktop-.png "Dr. Patel is active on social media = prime!")

Being active + social:

-   
    Posts before-and-after results to **build trust with possible cosmetic patients**.

-   
    Sends updates on what’s happening around the office so **patients are always in the know**.
